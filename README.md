# Research interests
Coastal ecosystems are vital for climate risk mitigation and adaptation, yet these ecosystems themselves are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. My research centres on the question: **How does the resilience of these ecosystems to climate change affect their functioning under such pressures?** I am also passionate about developing new Earth and data science methodologies to deepen our understanding of coastal ecosystem dynamics and their functions at regional and global scales.

I am currently leading a research line to deepen our understanding of their sustainability and functionality amidst climate change by modeling the storm resilience of global mangrove ecosystems. This groundbreaking research has delivered the first global systematic analysis of storm risks to mangroves and uncovered potential significant regional shifts under future climate scenarios ([Mo et al., 2023, Front. Ecol. Environ.](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fee.2650)). This research has been funded by a _Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellowship_ (2022-2024) and a _Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship_ (2020-2022).

However, these ecosystems face mounting threats from climate change and human- activities. My research focuses on uncovering the impacts of these disturbances on blue carbon dynamics using long-term satellite and field-based environmental data. One significant finding is that, despite being subjected to various climate and human-induced disturbances (e.g., [Mo et al., 2017, Ecosphere](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.1811) & [Mo et al., 2017. Remote Sens.](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/6/547)), coastal marshes in Louisiana, US, have shown the potential to contribute to climate mitigation by extending their growing seasons from 1984-2014 ([Mo et al., 2019. Ecol. Evol.](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5215)).

This research offers a comprehensive analysis of past and future storm-induced power outages worldwide by integrating satellite-based nighttime light observations, global electricity network databases, and historical and climate projections—**insights previously unavailable at this scale**. Our findings reveal that, globally, recovery times for electric power systems following tropical cyclone damage have worsened, increasing by approximately 1.5 days per decade ([Mo et al., 2025, Environ. Res.: Infrastruct. Sustain.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4505/ade474)). We also project that most regions are expected to experience more severe tropical cyclone-induced outages under future climate conditions (RCP8.5 2050) ([Hall et. al. Preprint.](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4650238/v1)). This work received funding from  NERC and the Oxford John Fell Fund.
